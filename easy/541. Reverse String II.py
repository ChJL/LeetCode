#Tag:String
'''
Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. 
If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original. 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

SOL: just string operation

        for i in range(0, len(a), 2*k):
